	<h1>Float (makes no sense)</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>A block level element when floated, no longer takes up the whole parent. It's no longer a block. It's not even a display type. You can't add margin.</li>
		<li>The element, will go as far left (or right) as it possible can, until it runs into another floating thing or runs out of room.</li>
		<li>A floated element is in it's own universe. They dont pass their height up to non-floating parents. Static + float = weird.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>IMPORTANT: to force a floated element to pass it's height up to its parent... Make the parent float or Set the parent to have overflow:hidden.</li>
		</ol>
