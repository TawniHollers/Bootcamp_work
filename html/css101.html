<!-- BLOCK ELEMENT (div, p, h1) -->
<!-- 1. A BLOCK level element, by default, takes up ALL  the pace on the line. -->
<!-- 2. It can have a height and a width -->
<!-- 3. NOTHING can EVER be on either side of the block (internal to the parent). Even if you change the width, margin will simply be added -->
<!-- 4. Default is 100%, it can be greater than 100% -->

				Grandchild

<!-- INLINE ELEMENT -->
<!-- 1. Can have stuff on either side. -->
<!-- 2. Can NOT have a height or a width. It will ignore both. -->
<!-- 3. It will respect left and right padding/margin, but will totally ignore top and bottom -->
<!-- 4. Will laugh at you if you  try to apply block level rules (few exceptions apply) -->

<!-- INLINE BLOCK -->
<!-- 1. Can have stuff on either side (just like inline) -->
<!-- 2. Can have height and width (just like block) -->
<!-- 3. Can have top/bottom margin/padding (just like block) -->
	<span class="inline-tag">
		I am inline. I dont really care if you try and set my width or height. Seriously, I dont care. I will be as big as I wanna be.
